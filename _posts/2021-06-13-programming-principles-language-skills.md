title: I Believe in Programming Principles 🧠

I’ll keep this one short. I believe that there is a distinct value in *thinking* like a programmer that transcends the knowledge of a particular language.

Actually—I don’t just believe that there is. I *know* that there is.

Right now I’m diving deep into the React framework. Building apps which fired off numerous components based off of an array of data *changed the way I think* about building pages in general. “Hard coding is for fools! Automate that mess!”

As a result I refactored an aspect of my portfolio page with the same principle in mind. I figured out a way—in Liquid, a totally different framework—to do essentially the same thing I was doing in React. Same programming principle. Different language.

My lightbulb 💡 moment was hardly the Copernican revolution. But the whole process did cement in my mind the idea that programming know-how is *independent* (at least to a degree) of specific languages.
