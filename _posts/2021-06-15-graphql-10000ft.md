(I got this info from [this](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/graphql-101-with-anthony-campolo/id1539945251?i=1000522248934) podcast.)
* **What:** GraphQL is a query language, it serves as a layer between front-end and back end
* **Why:** GraphQL minimizes type errors
* **Why:** GraphQL allows you to query for the specific bite-sized nugget of data you need
* Though often associated with #NodeJS and #reactjs , it’s compatible with a variety of front- and back-ends
* To keep up to speed on GraphQL, follow the broader conversation, not just one person. (But a good person to start with would be the podcast’s guest: 
@ajcwebdev.)
