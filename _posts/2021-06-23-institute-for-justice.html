<h1>Project for the Institute for Justice</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Nirmal Mekala. I applied to the Institute for Justice web developer position a little while ago and wanted to send a little follow up message. I’m still interested in the role. I love the work that the Institute for Justice is doing. As a resident of Minneapolis, I’m grateful that IJ has removed barriers to economic participation for local taxi drivers and African hair braiding salons. Furthermore, I’m passionate about ending qualified immunity in an era where (despite steps of progress) police accountability is hard to come by. I wholeheartedly support the goals of IJ.</p>

<p>I’m also confident that I can provide value to IJ in the web developer position. But I thought it might be worth it <em>show</em> that rather than just say it. Check out some proposals for sprucing up the navigation bar of IJ’s landing page. And feel free to implement what I’ve proposed if you’d like!</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>The homepage of the Institute for Justice does a great job of drawing users in to IJ’s important work. You immediately see faces and get the message: “This place is helping <em>real</em> people!”</p>

<p><strong>But once you start to navigate the page, the user experience gets a little clunky.</strong> The “Support IJ,” “Give Now,” and “Report Abuse” buttons all compete for your attention. And when you hover your mouse over these buttons, you get surprising responses—“Give Now” turns dark and the hamburger menu suddenly flashes a new color scheme.</p>

<p>Smoothing out these little bumps in the UX is not just a vanity project. Thoughtful design increases the likelihood of users engaging with calls to action (e.g. the “Give Now” button). <strong>Implementing this redesign could increase donations.</strong></p>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>I created a new navigation bar. By giving it a dark but translucent color, the logo stands out more, but you still see the background image. The user’s eye is drawn to the “Give Now” button by a pop of color, but they can still see the “Report Abuse” and “Support IJ” buttons clearly.</p>

<div class="post__content-wrapper">
	<div class="post__dw-80-mw-100">
		<figure class="post__figure-w-100">
			<img class="post__image-w-100" src="/assets/images/institute-for-justice/ij-before.png" alt="Institute for Justice website before changes">

			<figcaption>After changes</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>
</div>

<p>Then, instead of changing colors or adding borders around icons, the site can respond to user’s hover action with an elegant animation of the button or icon.</p>

<p>You can view all the code used for these changes below. Just a few lines of CSS can help people use the site more easily.</p>

{% highlight css %}

/* Adding a dark, transluscent nav background */
.re-menu-container {
	background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
}

/* Adjusting colors and hover animations on menu items */
.re-menu-box {
	transition: all 200ms ease-in-out
}
.re-menu-box:hover {
	background-color: transparent;
	color: white;
	transform: translateY(-5px)
}

.re-menu-search {
	background-color: transparent;
	border: 0px solid black;
	transition: all 200ms ease-in-out;
}
.re-menu-search:hover {
	transform: translateY(-5px)
}

.re-menu-donate {
	background-color: #10757b;
	border: 3px solid #10757b;
	transition: all 200ms ease-in-out;
	letter-spacing: 2px;
}
.re-menu-donate:hover {
	transform: translateY(-5px);
}

.re-menu-report-abuse {
	background-color: transparent;
	border: 0px solid black;
	transition: all 200ms ease-in-out;
	letter-spacing: 2px;
}
.re-menu-report-abuse:hover {
	transform: translateY(-5px);
}

/* Changing colors on the “Support IJ” button */
/* (This is not currently a class on the website) */
.support-ij {
	background-color: #000000;
	color: #FFFFFF;
	border-right: 1px solid #393939
}
{% endhighlight %}


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I believe these changes can provide real value for the Institute for Justice and have the potential to increase funding. And while these suggestions are related to the front-facing user experience, they demonstrate the conscientious problem-solving that I apply across the web development stack.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this note. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>Best,</p>
