These are notes from Zach Gordon’s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuvAMcsoreI).

* **What?** Gatsby is a static site generator that runs on your computer with Node.js and generates pre-configured HTML.
	* It uses GraphQL to get data from anywhere.
	* It uses React for templating (and CSS for styling).
	* It has a plugin architecture.
* **Why?** It’s fast because the HTML is pre-rendered; the server doesn’t need to generate HTML for you after being called.
* **Why?** It’s secure because hacking the server just means accessing HTML files.
* **Why?** It offers an appealing modern development stack.
* **Why?** It has a solid team, an open source community, and solid documentation.

👉🏾 (Personal **why**) I plan to use it for an upcoming project to take advantage of its Markdown integration, implementation of React, and speed ⚡️.
