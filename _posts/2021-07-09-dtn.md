## Accessing the Refactored Widget
* *Find a live preview [here](https://dtnnewslistwidget.gatsbyjs.io/).*
* *Find the code for the project [here](https://github.com/ndmekala/dtn-news-list-widget).*

## Background
This is a refactoring of DTN News List Widget (an embeddable widget that lists articles from DTN’s Content Services). You can find the original version [here](https://cs-widget-docs.dtn.com/news-list-widget/news-list-widget-1.0-latest.html), in the DTN Content Services documentation.

I opted to add two levels of functionality. The first solves a problem and the second makes the widget more dynamic.

Note that the links in the live preview won’t work. More information is needed to relate the slugs provided by the API to actual article links.
## Filling Holes
The problem with the widget at present is that the data it pulls from the API doesn’t always include an associated image. This isn’t accounted for in the rendering of the widget, so the appearance of the articles is uneven. There are holes.
<div class="post__content-wrapper">
<div class="post__dw-80-mw-100">
		<figure class="post__figure-w-100">
			<img class="post__image-w-100" src="/assets/images/dtn/dtn-news-list-widget.png" alt="DTN widget before changes">
			<figcaption>Before changes</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>
</div>
I rebuilt this widget and made it validate image data. It now checks to see if image information exists, and renders a default image if it doesn’t.
Here’s the JSX:
<div class="post__content-wrapper">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ndmekala/79f0d253f5749c9251f70a812c378704.js"></script>
</div>
No more holes!
<div class="post__content-wrapper">
    <div class="post__dw-80-mw-100">
		<figure class="post__figure-w-100">
			<img class="post__image-w-100" src="/assets/images/dtn/dtn-news-list-widget-revised.png" alt="DTN widget after changes">
			<figcaption>After changes</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>
</div>
## Adding Pagination
Another limitation of the current widget is that it doesn’t make full use of all available article data. The data can be broken into pages and pagination controls can be added. This allows viewers to quickly scroll through all available article data, making the widget more dynamic. You can test out how it works at the preview above.
