##  üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Don‚Äôt Let This Guide Stress You Out üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Learning to code‚Äîespecially when you are don‚Äôt have experience with code and are trying to learn it in a short period of time‚Äîis an immense effort.

Throw in networking, blogging, contributing to open source, building projects, and meetups (all common advice for folks getting into tech and things I mention below) and it can start to feel really overwhelming.

Don‚Äôt panic!

No one does *all* these things. I didn‚Äôt even do most of them, and I got hired. My point is writing this is not to burden aspiring engineers with a huge list of todos, but to put together helpful tips to glean from with the goal of *slowly* and *sustainably* rolling small steps into your current workflow.

**This is the list I wish I had when I started my coding journey.**

## LinkedIn Posts and Follows

Following content creators who explain tech and the tech industry can be helpful. But be careful with social media! It can be a big time-waster and can trigger imposter syndrome. *You belong in tech* even if it feels like everyone else‚Äôs latest project or internship or (fill in the blank) is ‚ú®amazing‚ú® and your stuff is just normal.

## Gaining Real World Experience Prior to Your First Real World Job ü§î

> &#42; entry level position &#42;

> &#42; 1-2 years experience required &#42;

Because it‚Äôs so common for entry level positions to require experience, it‚Äôs a good idea to plan how you will gain *some* form of experience you can put on your r√©sum√© and talk about in interviews. Here are some ideas in order of increasing complexity/difficulty/effort-intensiveness. (The higher options may be more impressive to prospective employers).

1. Personal projects
2. Real-world projects
	1. e.g. doing a website for a local business or organization *pro bono*
	2. e.g. submitting a PR/ contributing to an open source project (Tip: contributions to documentation are legitimate contributions, but possibly more suitable to early-career devs. I‚Äôve contributed to the Mozilla Development Network in this fashion and have been able to discuss what I did in an interview.)
	3. e.g. hosting a personal project on an app store or public facing URL to make   it more ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù
3. *Paid* real-world projects
	1. e.g. actually getting paid to create websites for businesses or freelancing on a site like Fiverr or Upwork

## Don‚Äôt Sleep on Networking

**Don‚Äôt sleep on networking.** It‚Äôs unrealistic to think that you will receive interviews and job offers in a reasonable time frame without it.

*And don‚Äôt wait to network.* Weaving small networking steps into your workflow early on in your coding journey is a good idea.

Here are some general principles to consider with networking:

- Cultivate your online presence
	- A personal site/online portfolio - [Josh Comeau has an excellent guide on creating an online portfolio](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/)
	- a GitHub profile
	- a LinkedIn profile
- Reach out to folks *locally* and *online*
	- Connect with people in your network, prospective employers, and recruiters via Twitter, LinkedIn, or email
	- Attend local meetups‚Äîaim at presenting!

### How I got my current position:

 1. I reached out to a friend in my network.
 2. He let me know about a position for which he knew the recruiter.
 3. I got in touch with the recruiter via email after applying to a position and she connected me with the CXO of the company.
  4. The interview process revealed that I was a really good match for this position, and the rest is history!

## Be a Tinkerer

Fool around with stuff. Be curious.

Everything you do with computing contributes to your overall knowledge as a developer, even if it‚Äôs stupid as hell or doesn‚Äôt culminate in a finished project. Environment variables clicked for me when I was trying to get [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) to pull in my terminal‚Äôs [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme so I could feel like a vampire üßõüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. **How stupid is that!?** But learning about environment variables helped me contribute to the Mozilla Development Network‚Äôs documentation‚Ä¶ ü§Ø

Likewise, my half-finished and fully-abandoned projects have still contributed to my career. I didn‚Äôt get a shiny new website out of my tinkering, but I got exposure to new tools, experience, and skills that are benefiting me now. Try to finish your projects, but don‚Äôt sweat it if you don‚Äôt. You probably learned something.

## Steer Clear of Bad Advice üö®

When I was first looking at getting a job in tech, I was too uncritical about advice I saw on the internet.

For example [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB4bSDznwgM) video implies that three months would be on the long end for someone going from no coding experience to hired in tech. That‚Äôs a pretty ridiculous take (see Ray Morrison‚Äôs post linked above), but unfortunately I received it uncritically and it resulted in unrealistic expectations.

[Another video](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingPhase)  suggested it was a good idea to try to find non-engineer positions where you could get your feet wet with code as a way to get practical experience and learn on the job. I would categorize this advice as unhelpful. There aren‚Äôt too many jobs that fit this description, and the result was that I wasted a lot of time searching for these jobs when I should have just been working on code.

No shade against the YouTubers who put out these particular videos; a lot of their content is great. I would simply advise folks to be critical of the information they take in about the field.

- I‚Äôve followed and appreciated Anna J. McDougall and am curious to read her book [*You Belong in Tech*](https://annamcdougall.com).
- I created a custom two-column r√©sum√© layout, but I think it‚Äôs likely that due to the formatting it did not pass [digital application tracking systems](https://resumegenius.com/faq/should-i-use-a-template-for-my-resume#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20using%20a%20resume%20template,employer%20uses%20to%20assess%20candidates). *Use a tried and true template.* Google around and I‚Äôm sure you can find free, vetted templates.
- I don‚Äôt have a ton of thoughts on technical interviews that center on a coding test (missed a cool opportunity once by bombing a tech interview I was underprepared for, got hired at two other places without one ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), but sprinkling in prep for those is a good idea too. [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is one resource.
