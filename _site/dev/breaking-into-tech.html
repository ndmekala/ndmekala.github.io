            <p><em>An in-progress and informal amalgamation of resources and thoughts on how to break into tech.</em></p>

<p>Learning to code‚Äîespecially when you are don‚Äôt have experience with code and are trying to learn it in a short period of time‚Äîis an immense effort.</p>

<p>Throw in networking, blogging, contributing to open source, building projects, and meetups (all common advice for folks getting into tech and things I mention below) and it can start to feel really overwhelming.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt panic!</p>

<p>No one does <em>all</em> these things. I didn‚Äôt even do most of them, and I got hired. My point is writing this is not to burden aspiring engineers with a huge list of todos, but to put together helpful tips to glean from with the goal of <em>slowly</em> and <em>sustainably</em> rolling small steps into your current workflow.</p>

<p><strong>This is the list I wish I had when I started my coding journey.</strong></p>

<h2 id="linkedin-posts-and-follows">LinkedIn Posts and Follows</h2>

<p>Following content creators who explain tech and the tech industry can be helpful. But be careful with social media! It can be a big time-waster and can trigger imposter syndrome. <em>You belong in tech</em> even if it feels like everyone else‚Äôs latest project or internship or (fill in the blank) is ‚ú®amazing‚ú® and your stuff is just normal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>* entry level position *</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>* 1-2 years experience required *</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ü§¨</p>

<p>Because it‚Äôs so common for entry level positions to require experience, it‚Äôs a good idea to plan how you will gain <em>some</em> form of experience you can put on your r√©sum√© and talk about in interviews. Here are some ideas in order of increasing complexity/difficulty/effort-intensiveness. (The higher options may be more impressive to prospective employers).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Personal projects</li>
  <li>Real-world projects
    <ol>
      <li>e.g. doing a website for a local business or organization <em>pro bono</em></li>
      <li>e.g. submitting a PR/ contributing to an open source project (Tip: contributions to documentation are legitimate contributions, but possibly more suitable to early-career devs. I‚Äôve contributed to the Mozilla Development Network in this fashion and have been able to discuss what I did in an interview.)</li>
      <li>e.g. hosting a personal project on an app store or public facing URL to make   it more ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>Paid</em> real-world projects
    <ol>
      <li>e.g. actually getting paid to create websites for businesses or freelancing on a site like Fiverr or Upwork</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dont-sleep-on-networking">Don‚Äôt Sleep on Networking</h2>

<p><strong>Don‚Äôt sleep on networking.</strong> It‚Äôs unrealistic to think that you will receive interviews and job offers in a reasonable time frame without it.</p>

<p><em>And don‚Äôt wait to network.</em> Weaving small networking steps into your workflow early on in your coding journey is a good idea.</p>

<p>Here are some general principles to consider with networking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cultivate your online presence
    <ul>
      <li>A personal site/online portfolio - <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/">Josh Comeau has an excellent guide on creating an online portfolio</a></li>
      <li>a GitHub profile</li>
      <li>a LinkedIn profile</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reach out to folks <em>locally</em> and <em>online</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect with people in your network, prospective employers, and recruiters via Twitter, LinkedIn, or email</li>
      <li>Attend local meetups‚Äîaim at presenting!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-i-got-my-current-position">How I got my current position:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>I reached out to a friend in my network.</li>
  <li>He let me know about a position for which he knew the recruiter.</li>
  <li>I got in touch with the recruiter via email after applying to a position and she connected me with the CXO of the company.</li>
  <li>The interview process revealed that I was a really good match for this position, and the rest is history!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="be-a-tinkerer">Be a Tinkerer</h2>

<p>Fool around with stuff. Be curious.</p>

<p>Everything you do with computing contributes to your overall knowledge as a developer, even if it‚Äôs stupid as hell or doesn‚Äôt culminate in a finished project. Environment variables clicked for me when I was trying to get <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> to pull in my terminal‚Äôs <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a> theme so I could feel like a vampire üßõüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. <strong>How stupid is that!?</strong> But learning about environment variables helped me contribute to the Mozilla Development Network‚Äôs documentation‚Ä¶ ü§Ø</p>

<p>Likewise, my half-finished and fully-abandoned projects have still contributed to my career. I didn‚Äôt get a shiny new website out of my tinkering, but I got exposure to new tools, experience, and skills that are benefiting me now. Try to finish your projects, but don‚Äôt sweat it if you don‚Äôt. You probably learned something.</p>

<h2 id="steer-clear-of-bad-advice-">Steer Clear of Bad Advice üö®</h2>

<p>When I was first looking at getting a job in tech, I was too uncritical about advice I saw on the internet.</p>

<p>For example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB4bSDznwgM">this</a> video implies that three months would be on the long end for someone going from no coding experience to hired in tech. That‚Äôs a pretty ridiculous take (see Ray Morrison‚Äôs post linked above), but unfortunately I received it uncritically and it resulted in unrealistic expectations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingPhase">Another video</a>  suggested it was a good idea to try to find non-engineer positions where you could get your feet wet with code as a way to get practical experience and learn on the job. I would categorize this advice as unhelpful. There aren‚Äôt too many jobs that fit this description, and the result was that I wasted a lot of time searching for these jobs when I should have just been working on code.</p>

<p>No shade against the YouTubers who put out these particular videos; a lot of their content is great. I would simply advise folks to be critical of the information they take in about the field.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>

<ul>
  <li>‚≠êÔ∏è <strong>A resource I want to dig into that seems promising for outlining how to get into tech is Shawn Wang‚Äôs</strong> <a href="https://learninpublic.org/"><em>Coding Career Handbook</em></a></li>
  <li>I‚Äôve followed and appreciated Anna J. McDougall and am curious to read her book <a href="https://annamcdougall.com"><em>You Belong in Tech</em></a>.</li>
  <li>I created a custom two-column r√©sum√© layout, but I think it‚Äôs likely that due to the formatting it did not pass <a href="https://resumegenius.com/faq/should-i-use-a-template-for-my-resume#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20using%20a%20resume%20template,employer%20uses%20to%20assess%20candidates">digital application tracking systems</a>. <em>Use a tried and true template.</em> Google around and I‚Äôm sure you can find free, vetted templates.</li>
  <li>I don‚Äôt have a ton of thoughts on technical interviews that center on a coding test (missed a cool opportunity once by bombing a tech interview I was underprepared for, got hired at two other places without one ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), but sprinkling in prep for those is a good idea too. <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hackerrank</a> is one resource.</li>
