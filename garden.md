title: What the Garden? 🌿

OK, I’ll admit having a “garden” page on your website is a little unorthodox. What is it? Why’s it here? *What the garden?*

I got the idea from folks like [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and [others](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) who are challenging the notion of a traditional blog.

The idea of a digital garden is that it’s a place where your *ideas* grow. It’s easy to intake endless amounts of random information. It’s harder to actually learn something concrete and then articulate that learned thing. It’s harder still to connect learned thing to the bigger picture of a repertoire of skill and knowledge.

Anyone can grow a million dandelions in a grassy lot; it takes *time* and *energy* to cultivate a beautiful garden.

And at the same time, no garden is perfect. Weeds grow incessantly. Any order is ultimately fleeting. And sometimes, you endure the sparse appearance of a particularly small bush, trusting that in time gaps will fill and the whole space will be looking lush. The wise gardener embraces all these aspects as part of the gardening process. So with this digital garden: the goal isn’t perfection. It’s thoughtful cultivation of knowledge and it’s natural result: *growth*.

So welcome to my digital garden! Below you’ll find a curated (not chronological) list of articles (and snippets) I’ve written. I hope some aspect of this mental exercise will provide value for you. 🙏🏾
