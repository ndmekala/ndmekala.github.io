title: What the Garden? 🌿

OK, I’ll admit having a “garden” page on your website is a little unorthodox.

I got the idea from folks like [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and [others](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) who are challenging the notion of a traditional blog.

The concept of a digital garden is that it’s a place where your *ideas* grow. It’s easy to intake endless amounts of random information. It’s harder to actually learn something concrete and then articulate that learned thing. It’s harder still to connect what you’ve learned to a broader repertoire of skill and knowledge.

Anyone can grow a million dandelions in a grassy lot; it takes *intentionality* to cultivate a garden.

And at the same time, no garden is perfect. Weeds grow incessantly. Any order is ultimately fleeting. And sometimes, you endure the sparse appearance of a particularly small bush, trusting that in time gaps will fill and the whole space will eventually be green and lush. The wise gardener embraces all these aspects as part of the gardening process.

So with this digital garden: the goal isn’t perfection. It’s thoughtful cultivation of knowledge toward true cognitive *growth*.

Now you know why you’re here. *Enjoy your stroll through the garden 🌿.* Below you’ll find a curated (not chronological) list of articles (and snippets) I’ve written. I hope this mental exercise of mine provides value for you.
